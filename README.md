# ðŸŽ¥ Graph the Reel: Personalized Movie Recommendations with Neo4j

This project explores the power of graph databases and recommendation algorithms using Neo4j. By working with a movie dataset on the Neo4j sandbox, I leveraged the PageRank algorithm to identify the most influential films in the network. I then inserted myself as a new user node, added connections to 10 movies Iâ€™ve actually watched, and generated personalized recommendations using Neo4jâ€™s recommendation module.

Finally, I re-ran the PageRank algorithm to observe how my interactions influenced the global movie rankings â€” all captured in a demo video.
